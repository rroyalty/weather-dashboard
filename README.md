# Daily-Scheduler

## Description 

The following is the README for the project daily-scheduler, which is the repository created for the fifth homework assignment of the UNH Bootcamp course. For the assignment, I was tasked with creating an hourly schedule which stores entries for later use.

![Example given:](https://github.com/rroyalty/daily-scheduler/blob/main/Example/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)  

I had a hard time with this homework. I got to what I thought was a good finished project, and then a classmate pointed out to me that it's supposed to be a 'workday' scheduler. I spent hours trying to get the program to only display hours between 9 to 5. If I'd been paying attention this would have been easier to build in from the get go, but I couldn't seem to get it to work without breaking the code. I might try to fix it again later on, but I've already spent half a work day trying to fix it and I've got other things I need to do.
