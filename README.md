# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

The following is the README for the project weather-dashboard, which is the repository created for the sixth homework assignment of the UNH Bootcamp course. For the assignment, I was tasked with creating a dashboard that made API requests to an open weather API in order to present the user with current weather conditions of whichever city that they searched and also a five day forecast of that city. Previous city searches are to be saved in local storage for future use, if desired.

![Example given:](https://github.com/rroyalty/weather-dashboard/blob/main/assets/06-server-side-apis-homework-demo.png)  

This homework wasn't so bad, I don't seem to be having very much trouble with understanding API calls. I actually spent more time on the CSS and HTML, I think, than I did the javascript for this one.

One notable change I did as compared to the instructions:

Instructions said:
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

My homework does:
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the local forecast
WHEN The local forecast fails to display
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
WHEN The local forecast fails to display AND there are no previous searches
THEN I am presented with the weather for Washington D.C.
